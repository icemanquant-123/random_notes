### MAJOR REGIME SHIFT IMPLICATIONS:

**From 12M to 24M, the market has shifted from:**
- ❌ Altseason → ✅ BTC dominance rising (1.58 vs 1.3)
- ❌ Low attention → ✅ High attention (1.19 vs 1.1)
- ❌ Weak futures → ✅ Strong contango (1.65 vs 1.13)
- ❌ M2 contraction → ✅ M2 expansion (1.47 vs 1.22)
- ❌ Fear → ✅ Greed (1.34 vs 0.9)
- ❌ Low on-chain activity → ✅ High activity (1.52 vs 0.79)
- ❌ Weak stablecoin supply → ✅ Rising supply (1.39 vs 0.83)
- ❌ BTC leaving exchanges → ✅ BTC back on exchanges (1.61 vs 1.01)

**WARNING SIGNS THAT INTENSIFIED:**
- 🔴 Even MORE overleveraged longs (1.78 vs 1.42)
- 🔴 Even MORE profit-taking (1.84 vs 1.12)
- 🔴 Even MORE selling pressure (1.95 vs 1.11)
- 🔴 BTC back on exchanges (bearish reversal)
- 🔴 Extreme tail risk (1.62 vs 0.26)
- 🔴 Much higher inflation (1.57 vs 0.85)

**INTERPRETATION:**
The 24M view shows Bitcoin entered a **euphoric phase** with:
- Strong momentum and attention
- Greed prevailing over fear
- Rising leverage and speculation
- But ALSO extreme profit-taking and selling pressure
- BTC dominance recovering (healthier)
- Macro turning supportive (M2 expansion)

This is a **classic late-bull market setup** with high risk/reward asymmetry - strong upside momentum but extreme leverage, profit-taking, and elevated valuations create significant downside risk.

## Current Market Regime Assessment

**Based on factor analysis:**

**Bull Case (40% weight):**
- Network fundamentals strong (hashrate)
- Coins leaving exchanges (accumulation)
- Momentum positive across all timeframes
- Stablecoin buying power available
- HODLer conviction remains high
- Liquidity (M1) expanding

**Bear Case (60% weight):**
- Heavy profit-taking by realized P&L
- Old coins moving (distribution)
- Overleveraged longs (funding rates)
- Weak futures premium (no conviction)
- Global M2 contracting (macro headwind)
- Altcoin season (late-cycle behavior)
- Very low BTC attention/dominance
- High expected volatility (uncertainty)
- Selling pressure elevated

**Regime:** **Late-stage bull market with distribution characteristics**

- Not euphoric (low attention) = potentially sustainable OR early rollover

**Most Likely Scenario:** Choppy consolidation with elevated volatility in near-term, final push possible but risk/reward less favorable than earlier in cycle.
